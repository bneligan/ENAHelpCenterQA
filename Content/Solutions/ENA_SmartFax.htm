        <h2>Problem Sending SmartFax</h2>
        <p>Please follow these steps in sequence, testing as necessary after each/any change is made: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Make sure SmartFax ATA is powered on and registered.</li>
            <li>
                Make sure fax machine is powered on, not in sleep mode, not low/out of memory, and is set to DTMF (not Dial Pulse).
            </li>
            <li>Power cycle fax machine.</li>
            <li>Make sure ATA is on its own dedicated network drop.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Cannot share network drop with another networked device (like a multi-function printer/scanner/copier/fax).</li>
                <li>Less preferred, but often acceptable to use an unmanaged Ethernet switch deployed at the existing network drop to support other data-networked devices alongside the fax ATA.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Make sure you have dial tone when you go off hook on the fax machine.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If no dial tone, check for incorrect or disconnected telco cabling between phone 1 port of fax ATA and line port of fax machine.</li>
                <li>
                    If telco cabling is undamaged and correctly connected and there is still no dial tone at fax machine, escalate to ENA CTAC.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Make sure the fax transmission attempt is being dialed as 10 digits (like dialing from a cell phone).</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure the fax machine is not pre-pending an area code or an 8 or a 9 to the dialed number before signaling the fax call.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                Check for error codes from the fax machine when attempting to send.
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the error code or reason to further troubleshoot or document error code/reason to provide to ENA Support.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Locate and use the fax machine model troubleshooting guide for additional troubleshooting steps to try.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>As needed, document and provide the fax machine make and model to ENA Support.</li>

            <li>
                As needed, provide the link to fax machine's electronic user guide to ENA Support.
            </li>

            <li>Make sure SmartFax ATA is powered on.</li>
            <li>Make sure fax machine is powered on, not in sleep mode, not out of paper, not out of toner, not low/out of memory, and is SET to auto-answer.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Make sure fax machine is set to "Fax Only" and not set to "Fax/Tel."</p>

            <li>Check for incorrect or disconnected telco cabling between phone 1 port of fax ATA and line port of fax machine.</li>
