        <h1>Start an ENA SmartConference</h1>
        <p>To start your ENA SmartConference you need the following information, which ENA will provide:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your ENA&#160;SmartConference number</li>
            <li>Your ENA&#160;SmartConference number moderator code </li>
            <li>The ENA SmartConference participant code </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Start a conference at any time by dialing your ENA SmartConference number and entering your moderator code. </p>
        <p>Participants join your conference by dialing the ENA SmartConference number and entering the participant code you provide. </p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1a5091;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">If there is already an active conference that was started using your moderator code, the error message informs you that the conference has already started. This may indicate that an unauthorized user is using your moderator code. This can occur if you have provided the moderator code instead of the participant code by mistake. To check this, use the web interface, or join the conference using the participant code.</p>
        <h1>Moderate Using a Phone</h1>
        <h2>Quick Key Reference</h2>
        <p>Press the * key before choosing one of the options, as indicated in the navigation map below. </p>

        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1a5091;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;"><b>Joining Tones</b> must be turned on prior to turning on <b>Joining Announcements</b>.

        <h2>Lock the Conference</h2>
        <p>To lock the conference so that no further participants can join, press *3. </p>
        <p>If you lock the conference and then perform a soft exit, you will still be able to join by dialing in as the moderator. However, no one will be able to join as a participant.</p>
        <p>To unlock the conference so that further participants can join, press *3 again.</p>
        <h2><a name="Recordin"></a>Record a Secondary Greeting</h2>
        <p>To record a secondary greeting that will be played to each participant when he or she joins the conference, press *01 and follow the prompts.</p>

        <p>You will not be able to start recording if you have reached the maximum number of recordings, or if you have less than one minute remaining of the maximum permitted recording time.</p>
        <p> Also, if you are recording a conference and you reach the maximum permitted recording time, the current recording will stop. In these cases, you will need to delete one or more older recordings using the Moderator Web Interface, in order to make room for new ones. </p>
        <p>If you start and stop recording more than once in the same conference, the recordings are saved as separate files, and count separately toward your maximum permitted number of recordings.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1a5091;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">Federal, state, or local regulations may require you to notify conference participants when a conference is being recorded, or there may be other restrictions on how recordings can be used. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are not in breach of such regulations, especially if recording notifications are not in use.</p>

            <li>You then hear the usual ringing or busy tone while the participant is being called. When the participant answers, press 1 to return to the conference.</li>
            <li>You then hear a prompt to record the participant's name before joining the conference. Record the name and press #.</li>
            <li>If the participant is not available or does not want to join the conference, press * to cancel and return to the conference.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note the following limitations for outdial calls and for participants that you add using outdial.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When dialing the number of the participant you are bridging in, you cannot dial the access code (normally *67) to control presentation of your calling number on the outgoing call. If you attempt to do so, the outdial attempt will fail and you will return to the conference.</li>
            <li>You cannot bridge in a conference telephone number to link this conference into another conference.</li>
            <li>Participants bridged into the conference using outdial are not included in the count of participants in the Call History page in the web interface.</li>
            <li>Participants bridged into the conference using outdial do not hear announcements when the call ends or when they are removed from it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>End the Conference</h2>
        <p>To end the conference, hang up the phone. Depending on your conference <MadCap:xref href="#Options">Options</MadCap:xref>, the conference will either end immediately or after 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>All participants who joined by dialing in are notified with an announcement that the conference has ended. Participants you bridged in using outdial will not hear the announcement.</p>
        <p>If you were recording the conference, the recording will stop. The recording will be saved on the server for later reference.</p>
        <h2>Make a Soft Exit</h2>
        <p>If you would like to make a soft exit, and leave the conference without ending it, so that the remaining participants can continue talking, press the * key twice. You will be prompted to confirm the soft exit by pressing 1. After this, you can hang up the phone.</p>

        <p>The panel for each participant (including the moderator) shows the following details:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The participant's calling telephone number.</li>
            <li>The participant's name, if the ENA SmartConference server can determine it. This is taken from a directory entry matching the calling number, if there is one, or from the caller name that the server received when this participant dialed in. </li>
            <li>A <b>Mute</b> button which allows you to mute this participant's phone so that no sound from it is played into the conference.</li>
            <li>A <b>Drop</b> button which allows you to remove this participant from the conference.</li>

        <p>On the left of each panel is an icon for each participant. The icon is color coded to show the participant's status in the call:</p>
