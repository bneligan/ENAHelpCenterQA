        <h2>About ENA</h2>
        <p>Education Networks of America® (ENA) is a leading provider of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solutions for K–12 schools, higher education institutions, and libraries. In 1996, ENA created the first statewide K–12 network in the U.S. and has since earned a reputation as experts in the design, deployment, and management of broadband, Wi-Fi/LAN, communication, and cloud solutions. ENA has helped hundreds of school districts, higher education institutions, and libraries connect the dots to create seamless, secure, and robust digital and collaborative learning environments. For more information, please visit www.ena.com, call 866-615-1101, or email <a href="mailto:info@ena.com">info@ena.com</a>.</p>
        <h2>Customer Support and the CTAC</h2>
        <p>ENA provides a comprehensive service desk and network operations center all rolled into one entity known as the Customer Technical Assistance Center (CTAC). The CTAC is ready to provide comprehensive support for each of ENA’s managed services, and you only need to call one phone number to resolve any and all issues. Support calls are directed to a live person in the U.S. who has in-depth experience working with school systems, higher education institutions, libraries, and government agencies. Additionally, CTAC personnel possess the specific skills needed to quickly address incidents or requests regarding ENA’s products and services.</p>
        <p>While many other organizations staff the front line of their “help desk” with clerical and/or referral support, ENA’s CTAC consists of highly-skilled customer support engineers (CSEs) who are extensively trained to expertly resolve any customer need. The CTAC’s CSEs are trained to focus on your needs while providing effective customer care and problem resolution, and over 90 percent of reported incidents and requests are resolved by the CTAC on the first call. That’s because our CSEs have obtained many industry-recognized certifications, including the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA), Certified Wireless Network Association (CWNA), and many others. Having these certifications solidifies the individual’s ability to manage, configure, operate, and troubleshoot wired and wireless networks, including the implementation and verification of connections to remote sites, with a high degree of customer care. The CTAC is a bridge into other departments of ENA, working closely with our engineering, sales, and implementations teams to provide quick escalations as needed to resolve issues.</p>
        <p>The CTAC also monitors the connectivity of managed ENA devices on the network, providing proactive contact to customers to alert them of a service issue. We are able to achieve a consistently high level of advance notification thanks to our network monitoring system. ENA’s rigorous monitoring capabilities enable proactive engagement to avoid or minimize the effect of service-impacting incidents. Our constant attention to your network uptime allows you to focus on other important technology and operational issues without having to worry about your network’s availability or restoration.</p>
        <p>ENA takes pride in our ability to deliver seamless, end-to-end network services while simultaneously allowing you as much insight into the details of your network activity as we can provide. ENA has developed sophisticated, web-based network monitoring and account management tools that are highly visible and accessible to you through the myENA user portal at my.ena.com. With myENA, you receive a 24x7x365 view of the status of your network along with visibility to see what is being done to correct any current incidents.</p>
        <h3>Contacting the CTAC</h3>
        <p>ENA’s CTAC is staffed 24x7x365 with highly-skilled CSEs available to offer specialized support via phone or email whenever you need assistance. ENA engineers are also available via an optional Live Chat tool through the myENA web portal Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m.–5:00 p.m. CT. Additionally, ENA's ticketing system—Ticket Tracker—can also be accessed through the myENA portal, allowing you to view ticket information about issues affecting your site(s), including the current status and steps underway to correct the issue.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Toll Free: 888-612-2880</li>
            <li>Email: <a href="mailto:support@ena.com">support@ena.com</a></li>
            <li>Live Chat &amp; Ticket Tracker: <a href="https://my.ena.com/">my.ena.com</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Support Process</h3>
        <p>When you contact the CTAC for assistance, a CSE will create a unique ticket specifically for your site and issue. You will be emailed the ticket number for reference and to report against in the future. The CTAC will assess your needs and determine if the issue(s) can be resolved immediately or if it will require additional research. If additional research is required, the CTAC will continually follow up with you throughout the duration of the investigation and validate that they have resolved the issue before closing the ticket. Any escalations for issue resolution will take place within the CTAC, which successfully resolves over 90 percent of issues without the need to escalate to other internal departments.</p>
        <p>We encourage you to request higher priorities if needed and escalate to ENA management as necessary, although your first point of contact should be the CTAC. If escalation to ENA management is necessary, the CTAC CSE will forward the issue to the appropriate person. You can also escalate your issue by following the Customer Service Escalation Path <a href="../Resources/Images/ENA_Technology_Leader_Welcome_Kit/ENA_Support_Escalation_Matrix.pdf">here.</a></p>
        <h3>Monitoring</h3>
        <p>If the CTAC identifies an outage via ENA’s monitoring system, you will be notified by email and telephone immediately. A ticket will also be opened, and you will be provided with a unique ticket number. We will determine if the affected location has power and begin the restoration process. If we need to dispatch a technician to your site(s), we will work with you and keep you updated every step of the way. Because of our proactive monitoring service, over 95 percent of our customers are notified about an outage before they are even aware it exists.</p>
        <h3>Maintenance Notices</h3>
        <p>The CTAC will notify you about any scheduled or emergency maintenance(s) that may impact your services. ENA has standard maintenance windows set for Tuesdays and Thursdays between 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m. CT. If you will be affected by a standard maintenance window, you will be notified a minimum of 48 hours prior to the maintenance. We will detail the maintenance being performed and the expected downtime.</p>
        <p>ENA may need to schedule emergency maintenance to keep services running or to make repairs to existing services. In either event, we will notify you as early as possible and provide an explanation. ENA’s vendors occasionally perform maintenance either remotely or on-site. In the event of any vendor maintenance, ENA will contact you to authorize the maintenance. When you approve the maintenance window, we will authorize the vendor to complete their work.</p>
        <p>Please feel free to contact the CTAC at <a href="mailto:support@ena.com">support@ena.com</a> with any questions regarding regularly scheduled maintenance. If there is a need to reschedule a maintenance window, we will make every attempt to accommodate that need. In some situations, however, rescheduling may not be possible.</p>
        <h3>ENA AlertU</h3>
        <p>ENA AlertU sends mass SMS texts or standard email messages from ENA’s CTAC in the event of a large-scale service interruption impacting your area. ENA AlertU, in addition to the CTAC’s proactive phone calls, ensures faster notifications for major network incidents.</p>

        <h3>E-rate Program Administration</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission (FCC)</a>
            <br />The FCC is the federal agency that oversees the E-rate program and the underlying Universal Service Fund program that funds the E-rate program.</p>
        <p>FCC Chairman and Commissioners<br />The FCC is directed by five appointed commissioners (three from the President of the United States’ party and two from the opposing party). The FCC chairman is one of the three individuals from the President’s party. This group of five votes on all FCC orders that set the rules for the E-rate program.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/wireline-competition">Wireline Competition Bureau (WCB)</a>
            <br />The WCB performs the FCC’s ongoing E-rate program work under guidance from the five commissioners.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.usac.org/default.aspx">Universal Services Administrative Company (USAC)</a>
            <br />The USAC is a private company that the FCC has hired to administer all of the USF programs (High Cost/Connect America, Low Income, Rural Healthcare, and E-rate).</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.universalservice.org/sl/">Schools and Libraries Division (SLD) of USAC</a>
            <br />The SLD is the section of USAC that administers the E-rate program. All E-rate filings and invoices/BEARs are sent to the SLD for processing and approval. The SLD is the group that schools are most likely to communicate with during the E-rate funding process. The SLD is restricted to following the rules and orders provided to them by the FCC and WCB, and the SLD will sometimes have to ask the FCC/WCB for clarification on those rules before completing their reviews of E-rate funding.</p>
